# > Sentiment Analysis on Movies Reviews

## The Business problem

This is a sentiment analysis problem, as in this case, consists of a classification problem, where the possible output labels are: `positive` and `negative`. Which indicates, if the review of a movie speaks positively or negatively. In our case it is a binary problem, but one could have many more "feelings" tagged and thus allow a more granular analysis.

## About the data

In this project, we will work exclusively with two files: `movies_review_train_aai.csv` and `movies_review_test_aai.csv`.

This is a dataset for **binary sentiment classification**.
